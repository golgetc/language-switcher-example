# Language Switcher Example

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use a JSON file for language switching in a web app. The project uses JavaScript to fetch translations from a JSON file and updates the text content of the page accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-switcher-example.git

## How It Works

1. The `translations.json` file contains translations for two languages: Turkish (tr) and English (en).
2. The JavaScript code in `index.html` fetches the translations from the JSON file.
3. The text content of the page is updated based on the selected language.
4. Clicking the "Change Language" button toggles between the two languages.

## Customizing Translations

To customize the translations or add more languages, simply edit the `translations.json` file and update the JavaScript code in `index.html` accordingly.
